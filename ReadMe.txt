Resume Editor

So far it is just a cover page editor with adding functionality

## Why 
I created this to get a better understanding of data manipulation as well as giving myself an application to quickly make multiple resumes that are all hand tailored to the organizations I am applying to.

## What I learned
I have had a growing love for XML and XSLT and enjoyed learning more about the functionalities of each.
